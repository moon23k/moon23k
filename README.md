## 🤖 Model Architecture
> &nbsp; The model architecture plays a pivotal role in machine learning engineering, as it can greatly influence performance.
Below, you'll find a collection of projects focused on exploring and establishing standards for appropriate model structures in three NLG tasks: Translation, Dialogue Generation, and Summarization.

## ⏰ Toward Efficiency
> &nbsp; Large-scale models with numerous parameters are known to yield improved performance. However, deploying such extensive models in typical computing environments can be limiting. To tackle this challenge, the following project introduces an efficient approach that ensures a certain level of performance while alleviating computational demands.

## 🔄 Neural Machine Translation
> &nbsp; Machine translation is the task of converting Text from Source Language into Target Language using a computer processing. The hegemony of machine translation was Rule-Based at the earliest, followed by SMT, and now NMT has been established. NMT aims to derive more accurate and natural translation results using Neural Networks. Below are experiments of various Neural Network Architectures for this purpose.

&emsp; [**• &hairsp; Back Translation**](https://github.com/moon23k/NMT_Back) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 
       [**• &hairsp; Multi-Lingual Translation**](https://github.com/moon23k/NMT_MultiLingual) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;

## 🗣️ Dialogue Generation
> &nbsp; Dialogue Generation is a task to generate a response to a previous utterance, just like humans do in a conversational situation. However, it is very difficult for the model to understand the flow of the conversation and return appropriate answers. Below are a set of experiments to generate more natural responses like humans do.

&emsp; [**• &hairsp; Characteristic Dialogue**](https://github.com/moon23k/Dialog_Char) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;

## 📝 Abstract Text Summarization
> &nbsp; Summarization Task summarizes long text into short sentences through Neural Networks, and the task can be devided into Extractive and Abstractive methods. Extractive Summarization selects key sentences from original text to make summary, whereas Abstractive Summarization creates a new summary sentence through the model's decoder. The experiments below mainly deal with Abstractive summary tasks.

&emsp; [**• Hierarchical Encoder**](https://github.com/moon23k/Summ_HierEnc) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
