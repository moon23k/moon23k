&nbsp; Hi there! I'm **moon**, somebody who's focusing on solving problems through artificial intelligence. AI has many subcategories, of which I find Natural Language Processing the most interesting. By profession, I'm a **NLP Machine Learning Engineer**. As an engineer, I aim to develop a model that can communicate naturally with people. So the codes in all my repos will contain the progress towards the goal. In addition to the codes in my git repos, reviews of the papers and personal research on artificial intelligence techniques are recorded on my <a href="">notion page</a>. If you would like to contact me, please contact me at the email address in the left information field.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Experiments
&nbsp; AI has a lot of variables, which means that different results can be derived depending on the settings of various variables. Therefore, many experiments from various viewpoints are required to obtain good results. Below is a series of experiments that introduce different approaches for three representative NLP tasks. 

<br>

**Neural Machine Translation**
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/NMT_BERT">How much performance will be improved if a large-scale pre-training model is applied to a NMT Task?</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/NMT_KoBERT">Compare BERT-base, BERT-MultiLingual and KoBERT models on Korean-English NMT Task</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/NMT_GAN">How can application of GAN through Reinforcement Learning technique improve translation quality?</a>

<br>

**Abstract Text Summarization**
> Text Summarization summarizes long text into short sentences through Neural Networks, and the task has Extractive and Abstractive methods. Extractive Summarization selects key sentences from original text to make summary, whereas Abstractive Summarization creates a new summary sentence through the model's decoder. The experiments below mainly deal with Abstractive summary tasks.


* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/Hier_Basics">Will the hierarchical structure help model to properly understand long sentences?</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/Recurrent_Transformer">How helpful is the recurrent structure on Transformer for dealing with long sentences?</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/Hier_BERT">How helpful can a large-scale pre-training model and hierarchical structure be to improve performance?</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/SUM_GAN">How can application of GAN through reinforcement learning technique improve Summarization Task?</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/SUM_NMT">Implementation of a model that handles the two tasks of translation and summarization at once</a>

<br>

**Dialogue Generation**
> In general, the dialog generation model tends to give general and repetitive answers independent of the flow of the conversation. This is because it is helpful to generate generic and repetitive answers in a way to reduce the loss in the learning process. Below is a set of experiments to address this and generate a more natural answer.

* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/Chat_BERT">Application BERT on Dialogue Generation Model would help the model to generate more natural utterance?</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/C2_Bot">Can application of GAN throgh Policy Graident Technique be helpful to give Characteristic on Dialogue Generation Model?</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/C3_Bot">Can Hierarchical Model Structure and GAN make Coherent Characteristic Chatbot?</a>

## ‚öì Anchor Codes
&nbsp; Recently, research on AI has been actively conducted, is currently in progress, and there will be more in the future. Accordingly, many new architectures and techniques are proposed. Therefore, a baseline is needed to objectively evaluate performance while applying a new method to existing tasks. I call this baseline code anchor code, and set the three most basic and frequently used architectures in NLP as anchors. Each is **Sequence-to-Sequence**, **Attention Architecture** and **Transformer**. The anchor codes for each representative task of NLP is as follows.

* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/NMT_Basics">Anchor Codes on **Neural Machine Translation**</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/SUM_Basics">Anchor Codes on **Abstractive Text Summarization**</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/moon23k/Chat_Basics">Anchor Codes on **Dialogue Generation**</a>

## üìÑ Ablation Studies
&nbsp; AI models show different results depending on the architecture and different techniques. Even a small change can make a big difference, so building an ability to control the change is necessary. Of course, this requires a lot of experiments, and below are the experiments.

## üíæ Data
&nbsp; AI model learns from large amounts of data. Therefore, high-quality bulk data is essential for building a good model. In addition to simply importing and processing data, I conduct data-related research such as tokenizer and data augmentation.
